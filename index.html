		<h3>List Of Ingredients</h3>
		<ul><li>5 ounces fettuccine</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
		<li>8 ounces sliced baby bella mushrooms</li>
		<li>1 large garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
		<li>&frac14; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
		<li>&frac14;cup heavy cream</li>
		<li>2 ounces Parrano truffle cheese, shredded</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon grated truffle cheese</li></ul>
		
<h4>Instructions</h4>
	<ol>
	<li>Boil the pasta according to package instructions. Reserve a few tablespoons of the starchy water before you drain the pasta once it’s cooked.</li>
	<li>In a 10-inch skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and garlic and stir to coat them in the butter. Add the salt and cook the mushrooms for 10 minutes or until they’ve released their moisture and they are deep brown in color.</li>
	<li>Transfer the cooked mushrooms and garlic to a bowl or plate. In the same pan, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the cream and stir to combine it with the butter. Once the cream is heated through add the shredded cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted. Add one or two tablespoons of the pasta water to thin the sauce.</li>
	<li>Add the mushrooms and pasta to the pan and stir to coat them evenly in the sauce. Garnish with the chopped parsley and grated cheese and serve.</li>
